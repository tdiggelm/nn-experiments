flowing back into britain amid hopes of another conservative government after fears last autumn of a labour election victory sent it flooding out u k portfolio investment is also returning while foreign buyers see u k growth and high bond yields as attractive they will be strong buyers of u k assets notably equities once the election is out of the way said analysts see this pressure as the

another conservative victory prove accurate with another half point later equity economist at credit suisse and moore said a full point reduction might be possible sterling will be held down by interest rate cuts in future rather than this active intervention he predicted of gilt edged cautioned against over optimistic forecasts but agreed a half point cut looked likely a cut before the

to his own christian democrats but officials noted that poehl has worked closely and successfully with finance minister gerhard stoltenberg since government took office in 1982 poehl the most senior

investor confidence after monday's wall street collapse treasury secretary james baker came under fire from critics who he helped to the crisis baker's weekend at the west german bundesbank for boosting interest rates seemed to signal an of an international accord to stabilize currency values nigel lawson british chancellor of the exchequer was among those who said the treasury statements helped spur a wave of stock sales by making already investors think that a clash between the two major economic powers would damage the world economy lawson told a london television tuesday i think the scale of the stock fall was very great that i think was partly due to statements that have been made by senior figures on the other side of the atlantic it was a dispute that should never have happened he added although baker appeared to over the at a called meeting with west german officials monday he still faced a of criticism on his return to the united states on tuesday baker cut short a long planned trip to to return here to deal with the economic crisis said one u s analyst of baker's weekend remarks his timing could not have been worse one government bond in new york said he actually thought that at the germans and threatening to the dollar down would work that doesn't show much understanding of international monetary however some analysts said west germany's march toward higher interest rates may have forced baker's hand on the baker may look responsible for this but if you go back to see what caused it of financial markets it was west german policy said robert brusca of nikko securities international in new york all mr baker did was to mention the obvious in public so making him responsible for it was a little like the he said after monday's talks the u s and west

global economic expansion a growing u s economy has been as a huge market for debtor country exports moreover baker the was worried that the republican party might face next year's presidential election with its main a economy badly a rise in global interest rates might worsen the debt crisis and completely choke off u s economic growth that has already slowed to a 3 2 pct annual rate there's no doubt that it can have an adverse effect on the economy and it's important that the turn around quickly or else the panic will feed on itself and eventually be a serious price to pay

reagan speaking for most people by that he was u s government sources said the secretary immediately returned to the treasury to be on market developments and their political impact for all of this it seems unlikely that baker's status in washington will because of the market fall asked by reporters if head should roll because of the wall street retreat texas democratic senator lloyd bentsen said
